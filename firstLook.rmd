## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
tempdata <- read.csv(file="comptonData.csv", header=TRUE)
tempdata[,4:10]<-tempdata[,4:10]-tempdata$Outside #normalize by outside temp
#look at

day <- equal.count(tempdata$Day, number = 2, overlap = 0.1)
xyplot(White ~ Outside | day,
	data = tempdata,
	layout = c(2,1),
	groups = thermo,
	auto.key = list(
		space = "top",
		title = "thermo",
		cex.title = 1,
		columns = 1),
	type = c("p","smooth"),
	main = "Temp delta from outside")
xyplot(White.with.Glass ~ Outside | day,
	data = tempdata,
	layout = c(2,1),
	groups = thermo,
	auto.key = list(
		space = "top",
		title = "thermo",
		cex.title = 1,
		columns = 1),
	type = c("p","smooth"),
	main = "Temp delta from outside")
xyplot(White.with.Zinc.Oxide ~ Outside | day,
	data = tempdata,
	layout = c(2,1),
	groups = thermo,
	auto.key = list(
		space = "top",
		title = "thermo",
		cex.title = 1,
		columns = 1),
	type = c("p","smooth"),
	main = "Temp delta from outside")
xyplot(Black ~ Outside | day,
	data = tempdata,
	layout = c(2,1),
	groups = thermo,
	auto.key = list(
		space = "top",
		title = "thermo",
		cex.title = 1,
		columns = 1),
	type = c("p","smooth"),
	main = "Temp delta from outside")
xyplot(Black.with.Glass ~ Outside | day,
	data = tempdata,
	layout = c(2,1),
	groups = thermo,
	auto.key = list(
		space = "top",
		title = "thermo",
		cex.title = 1,
		columns = 1),
	type = c("p","smooth"),
	main = "Temp delta from outside")
xyplot(Black.with.Zinc.Oxide ~ Outside | day,
	data = tempdata,
	layout = c(2,1),
	groups = thermo,
	auto.key = list(
		space = "top",
		title = "thermo",
		cex.title = 1,
		columns = 1),
	type = c("p","smooth"),
	main = "Temp delta from outside")
xyplot(Control ~ Outside | day,
	data = tempdata,
	layout = c(2,1),
	groups = thermo,
	auto.key = list(
		space = "top",
		title = "thermo",
		cex.title = 1,
		columns = 1),
	type = c("p","smooth"),
	main = "Temp delta from outside")
```

## next look at each separately

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }
#subtract "outside" from all numeric temp colums using some variation of apply or dplyr then look at plots
```
